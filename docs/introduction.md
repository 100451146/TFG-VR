## Introduction

Maybe you are new to the ML and confused on how to use different ML layers, maybe you have already had some experience and constructed some models in the directory. This section introduces what the TensorSpace is, how to use TensorSpace to visualize a model from scratch and how to apply TensorSpace to your existed models.

TensorSpace is an open source library for visualizing ML models, especially for visualizing CNN models in the browser. The attractive part is by using TensorSpace, you can visualize not only the basic model structure, but also how each layer generates different internal outputs based on different input values provided from the users.
